# Project Labyrinth

A text based labyrinth game where you can choose which direction to go.

## The problem

Wh ave used React, redux, thunks and APIs for this project. We get all of the coordinates for the game from an API and it saves your moves based on your username.
If we had more time we would have made a button to be able to go to the previous location as well as better media queries and genereal design.
